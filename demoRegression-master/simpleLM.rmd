# Bears regression model

### make a simple regression model

```{r}
bears <- read.csv(file="BEARS.csv",header = TRUE)
```

## Model LENGTH ~ NECK  this is an example  

```{r}
simp <- lm(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
plot(LENGTH~NECK,data=bears)
abline(simp)
summary.lm(simp)
```

## now predict the length of a bear who has a neck of 17, 22 and 26


```{r}
newData <- data.frame(NECK=c(17,22,26))
predict(simp,newData)
predict(simp,newData,se.fit=TRUE)
```
## Surely there is another variable that can better predict LENGTH than NECK. Find one and compare its performance to that of neck by it value of Adjusted-Rsquared (bigger is better).
